# Macro Tracker

A little app to track daily macros. Rails on the backend, iOS on the front end, powered by Hotwire Native.

## TODO

- Add a welcome page for new users.
- Clean up data modeling between Goals and Foods form. Goals should be the same for everyone: carbs, protein, fat, calories, fiber (optional).
- Remove dark mode. It's neat, but not necessary.
- Is all the namespacing necessary for the iOS path_configuration? Simplify it and make it easy to version.
